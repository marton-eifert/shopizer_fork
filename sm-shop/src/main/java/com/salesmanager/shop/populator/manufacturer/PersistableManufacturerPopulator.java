/**********************************
 * CAST-Finding START #2 (2024-02-06 09:25:40.708784):
 * TITLE: Avoid nested loops
 * DESCRIPTION: This rule finds all loops containing nested loops.  Nested loops can be replaced by redesigning data with hashmap, or in some contexts, by using specialized high level API...  With hashmap: The literature abounds with documentation to reduce complexity of nested loops by using hashmap.  The principle is the following : having two sets of data, and two nested loops iterating over them. The complexity of a such algorithm is O(n^2). We can replace that by this process : - create an intermediate hashmap summarizing the non-null interaction between elements of both data set. This is a O(n) operation. - execute a loop over one of the data set, inside which the hash indexation to interact with the other data set is used. This is a O(n) operation.  two O(n) algorithms chained are always more efficient than a single O(n^2) algorithm.  Note : if the interaction between the two data sets is a full matrice, the optimization will not work because the O(n^2) complexity will be transferred in the hashmap creation. But it is not the main situation.  Didactic example in Perl technology: both functions do the same job. But the one using hashmap is the most efficient.  my $a = 10000; my $b = 10000;  sub withNestedLoops() {     my $i=0;     my $res;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         my $j=0;         while ($j < $b) {             if ($i==$j) {                 $res = $i*$j;             }             $j++;         }         $i++;     } }  sub withHashmap() {     my %hash = ();          my $j=0;     while ($j < $b) {         $hash{$j} = $i*$i;         $j++;     }          my $i = 0;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         $res = $hash{i};         $i++;     } } # takes ~6 seconds withNestedLoops();  # takes ~1 seconds withHashmap();

 * CAST-Finding START #3 (2024-02-06 09:25:40.708784):
 * TITLE: Avoid string concatenation in loops
 * DESCRIPTION: Avoid string concatenation inside loops.  Since strings are immutable, concatenation is a greedy operation. This creates unnecessary temporary objects and results in quadratic rather than linear running time. In a loop, instead using concatenation, add each substring to a list and join the list after the loop terminates (or, write each substring to a byte buffer).
